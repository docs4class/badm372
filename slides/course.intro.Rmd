- gain insight from data, reproducibly **(with literate programming and version control)** and collaboratively, using modern programming tools and techniques



# Reproducible data analysis

---

## Reproducibility checklist


> What does it mean for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?


---

Near-term goals:

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done? 

Long-term goals:

- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?
